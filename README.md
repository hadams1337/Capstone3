Proposal #1
Make a classifier for 'is it poison ivy or not?'
I'm really allergic to poison ivy, so I would like to have an app to tell me if I'm looking at poison ivy.  Images of poison ivy and other plants, especially plants with three leaves, would be used to make a model that could tell the difference between plants that are and are not poison ivy.

Data Source:  Scrape google images

Proposal #2
Use zero-shot learning to identify animals using this dataset of animal pictures, labeled with attributes, and the accompanying vectors for each animal.  I would need to read about how to identify multiple characteristics in a picture.  I think encoding/decoding?

Proposal #3
Does listening to music make people move even when they have a conscious plan to stay still?  We could use an ARIMA strategy and this dataset to find out.

Subjects were asked to stay as still as possible for six minutes while wearing a movement-capture device on their head.  Music was played in 60 second intervals, with each subject having 60 seconds of silence in the beginning and end of the 6 minute interval.
